# Broker Discovery & Registration Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a Kubernetes-native broker discovery system using Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). This allows brokers to be registered declaratively via Kubernetes manifests and discovered dynamically by the manager.

## Architecture

### Before (Static Configuration)
- Manager had single, hardcoded broker URL via flag
- No multi-broker support
- No broker health monitoring
- No capability-based routing

### After (Dynamic Discovery)
```
Developer/Platform Operator
        ‚Üì
    Broker CRD (via GitOps)
        ‚Üì
    Kubernetes API
        ‚Üì
    Manager (BrokerRegistry)
        ‚Üì
    BrokerReconciler (health checks)
        ‚Üì
    DatabaseReconciler (dynamic selection)
        ‚Üì
    Selected Broker (provision/deprovision)
```

## Components Implemented

### 1. Broker CRD (`api/v1/broker_types.go`)

**Key Features:**
- **BrokerSpec**: Endpoint, cloud provider, region, capabilities, authentication, health check config
- **BrokerStatus**: Phase, last heartbeat, active deployments, version, conditions
- **Capabilities**: Declares what resource types and providers broker supports
- **Priority & Load**: Supports broker selection based on priority and current load

**Example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: platform.company.com/v1
kind: Broker
metadata:
  name: local-broker
  namespace: kidp-system
spec:
  endpoint: "http://broker-service:8082"
  cloudProvider: "on-prem"
  region: "local"
  priority: 100
  capabilities:
    - resourceType: Database
      providers: [postgresql, mysql, redis]
  healthCheck:
    endpoint: "/health"
    intervalSeconds: 30
```

### 2. BrokerReconciler (`internal/controller/broker_controller.go`)

**Responsibilities:**
- Periodic health checks against broker `/health` endpoint
- Update Broker CR status based on health
- Set conditions (Ready/Unhealthy)
- Track last heartbeat timestamp
- Configurable check intervals (default: 30s)

**Health Check Logic:**
1. Call broker's health endpoint
2. Check HTTP status (2xx = healthy)
3. Update Broker.Status.Phase
4. Update Broker.Status.LastHeartbeat
5. Set Ready condition
6. Requeue based on configured interval

### 3. BrokerRegistry (`pkg/brokerregistry/registry.go`)

**Core Functionality:**
- **Discovery**: Lists all Broker CRs from Kubernetes API
- **Caching**: In-memory cache with 30s TTL for performance
- **Selection**: Chooses best broker based on criteria:
  - Resource type (Database, Cache, Topic, etc.)
  - Cloud provider (azure, aws, gcp, on-prem)
  - Region
  - Specific provider (postgresql, mysql, etc.)
  - Health status (only selects Ready brokers)
  - Current load (avoids brokers at capacity)
  - Priority (higher priority preferred)

**Selection Algorithm:**
```go
Score = Priority + (1 - LoadPercentage) * 100 + RecentHeartbeatBonus
```

**API:**
```go
criteria := brokerregistry.SelectionCriteria{
    ResourceType:  "Database",
    CloudProvider: "azure",
    Region:        "eastus",
    Provider:      "postgresql",
}
broker, err := registry.SelectBroker(ctx, criteria)
```

### 4. Updated DatabaseReconciler

**Changes:**
- Replaced static `BrokerClient` with `BrokerRegistry`
- Dynamic broker selection on each provision/deprovision
- Selection based on database spec (engine, target)
- Logs selected broker details for observability

**Provision Flow:**
1. DatabaseReconciler detects new Database CR
2. Calls `BrokerRegistry.SelectBroker()` with criteria
3. Creates `brokerclient.Client` with selected broker's endpoint
4. Sends provision request to selected broker
5. Stores DeploymentID in Database status

**Deprovision Flow:**
1. Finalizer triggers cleanup
2. Selects broker (same capability as original)
3. Sends deprovision request
4. Gracefully handles broker unavailability

### 5. Broker Health Endpoint Enhancement

**Enhanced `/health` Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "time": "2025-10-03T10:30:00Z",
  "uptime": "2h15m30s",
  "uptimeSeconds": 8130,
  "activeDeployments": 0,
  "totalDeployments": 0,
  "failedDeployments": 0
}
```

### 6. Sample Broker Manifests

Created example configurations:
- **Local Broker** (`platform_v1_broker.yaml`): On-prem, all database types
- **Azure Broker** (`platform_v1_broker_cloud.yaml`): Azure SQL, Redis, Blob Storage
- **AWS Broker** (`platform_v1_broker_cloud.yaml`): RDS, ElastiCache, S3, MSK

## GitOps Integration

**Deployment Flow:**
1. Platform operator creates Broker YAML in Git repo
2. FluxCD/ArgoCD syncs Broker CR to management cluster
3. BrokerReconciler automatically discovers new broker
4. Begins health checks immediately
5. Broker becomes available to DatabaseReconciler once healthy
6. Developer creates Database CR
7. Manager selects appropriate broker automatically

## Benefits

## Usage Examples

### Register a Broker

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.company.com/v1
kind: Broker
metadata:
  name: aws-us-east-1
  namespace: kidp-system
spec:
  endpoint: "https://broker-aws-us-east-1.platform.company.com"
  cloudProvider: "aws"
  region: "us-east-1"
  priority: 100
  capabilities:
    - resourceType: Database
      providers: [rds-postgresql, aurora-mysql]
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f broker.yaml
```

### Check Broker Status

```bash
# List all brokers
kubectl get brokers -n kidp-system

# Output:
# NAME             PROVIDER   REGION      PHASE   ACTIVE   AGE
# local-broker     on-prem    local       Ready   0        5m
# aws-us-east-1    aws        us-east-1   Ready   15       2h

# Detailed status
kubectl describe broker local-broker -n kidp-system

# Watch health status
kubectl get broker local-broker -n kidp-system -w
```

### Create Database (Automatic Broker Selection)

```yaml
apiVersion: platform.company.com/v1
kind: Database
metadata:
  name: my-postgres
  namespace: my-app
spec:
  owner:
    kind: Team
    name: backend-team
  engine: postgresql
  version: "15"
  size: medium
```

Manager automatically:
1. Discovers available brokers
2. Filters by capability (Database + postgresql)
3. Selects best healthy broker
4. Provisions via selected broker

## Next Steps
